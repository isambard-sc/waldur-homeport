# Homeport resync: decisions and findings

Working record for the resync of `chryswoods/waldur-homeport` onto
`waldur/waldur-homeport`, carried out against the plan in
`chryswoods/waldur-mastermind:docs/guides/homeport-resync-plan.md`
(branch `claude/waldur-mastermind-resync-analysis-w824hs`).

**Base: upstream tag `8.1.3-rc.8` (`9fdb3e812`, 2026-09-01).**

The resync was originally carried out against `upstream/develop` at
`abd2f89e2` (2026-09-03) and then re-based onto the tag, so that this fork
tracks something upstream has cut and tested as a unit rather than a moving
development head. The tag is an ancestor of that develop commit — 11 commits
behind it — so the move was backwards by two days' worth of upstream work.
The analysis below was done against `abd2f89e2`; every figure was re-checked
against the tag and none of the conclusions change. The two trees differ in
only 26 files, and exactly one of them — `src/marketplace/details/DetailsPage.tsx`
— is also a file this fork changes. Even there the hunks are far apart
(upstream's at line 41, ours at line 27), so the replay was clean.

Worth knowing what the pin gives up. The 11 commits between the tag and that
develop commit are six merges: deployment-aware event groups, an enums and
descriptions refresh from Waldur MasterMind, hide-accounting-on-child-offerings,
error-shape config bootstrap, a maintenance-window-picker fix, and a VM
order-form tab-refetch fix. The last of those is a data-loss fix — without
`refetchOnWindowFocus: false` in `DetailsPage`, an in-progress order form
resets when the user switches tabs. That regression is back until the next tag.

The base moves again when upstream tags the next release candidate or 8.1.3
itself — not on every develop commit.

## 1. Divergence: the plan's figures hold

Re-measured against the fork point the plan names, `e506ac8e1` (2025-11-02):

Two figures do not reproduce, and both are artefacts rather than errors:

- **"This fork ahead: 4777 commits."** The real count of commits reachable
  from the fork head but not from `e506ac8e1` is **393**. The plan flags its
  commit counts as indicative from a bounded fetch, so this is expected; the
  file-level figures, which it presents as exact, are exact.
- **The area table in section 2 is incomplete.** It lists 13 areas. There are
  13 more with local changes it does not mention: `src/table` (2 files, +104),
  `src/core` (2, +150), `src/modal` (2, +83), `src/theme` (1, +66),
  `src/features` (1, +49), `src/workspace` (1, +42), `src/transitions.ts`
  (+28), `src/issues` (1, +18), `src/FeaturesEnums.ts` (+13), `src/form`
  (1, +9), plus `src/echarts`, `src/store`, `src/states.ts`, `src/resource`.
  Outside `src/`: `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `package.json`,
  `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts` and three `locales/*.json`. All are
  handled under section 6 below.

## 2. What the plan did not anticipate: upstream's restructure

Section 1 of the plan lists seven upstream migrations. Since it was written
upstream has gone further, and the extra moves matter more than any of them:

- **Yarn 1 -> Yarn 4 (Berry)**, `nodeLinker: node-modules`, with a
  `packageManager` pin. `corepack` cannot reach `repo.yarnpkg.com` through
  this environment's proxy; `COREPACK_NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmjs.org`
  fetches the same Yarn build from npm and works.
- **A workspace monorepo.** `packages/*` now holds `waldur-shell`,
  `waldur-ui`, `waldur-auth-core`, `waldur-api-client`, `waldur-telemetry`,
  `waldur-design-tokens`, `waldur-i18n-runtime`, `waldur-runtime-config`,
  `waldur-eslint-plugin-waldur`, plus `apps/micro-app-poc`.
- **The `@waldur/*` import alias is now `@/*`.** Every carried file needs
  rewriting; this is the single most mechanical part of the job.
- **Vite 7 -> 8, Vitest 3 -> 4, Tailwind v4**, Storybook added, Cypress
  replaced by Playwright (`e2e/`, `e2e-visual/`).
- Typecheck is `yarn tsgo -b` (`@typescript/native-preview`), not `tsc`.

## 3. `waldur-js-client` 7 -> 8: settled

**Adopt upstream's pin,** `8.1.3-rc.7.dev.20260901180117.270`, unchanged.

This is close to free. The fork's entire local delta to `package.json` since
the fork point was three lines — an `attr-accept` bump, a `core-js` addition
and a Yarn 1 `packageManager` pin — none of which survive contact with
upstream's dependency set, and none of which the fork's own code depends on.
Upstream's `package.json`, `yarn.lock` and `tsconfig.json` are taken as they
stand. Verified: install, `tsgo -b` and `lint:check` all pass on the adopted
tree with no local edits.

**The plan's section 5 concern 1 is real and is now confirmed.** The
published client predates the mastermind resync's accounting-summary work.
In `node_modules/waldur-js-client/dist/types.gen.d.ts`,
`OpenportalAccountingSummaryListData['query']` offers only
`customer_uuid`, `is_active`, `page`, `page_size` and `project_uuid`. The
resynced mastermind branch adds two things the client does not know about:

- `offering_name`, a filter — `waldur_openportal/filters.py:159`
- `include_offering_names`, an option — `waldur_openportal/serializers.py:598`

Regenerating and publishing a client is a cross-repository release step that
cannot be done from here, and pinning a locally generated build would
immediately desync this fork from upstream again. So the resolution is the
plan's own second option: **call those two parameters without the generated
helper's typed query**, and leave the pin alone. See section 4.

Concern 2, the eight feature flags, is unaffected: they are read through
`ENV.plugins` and `FeaturesEnums`, not through the generated client, and are
carried in section 6.

## 4. OpenPortal: upstream superseded nearly all of it

This is the plan's largest miscall, and it runs the same way the mastermind
resync did — the carry-forward list collapses on inspection.

The plan's section 3.2 reads: "42 are real components upstream did not take
... Treat this as the bulk of the job." The file _counts_ are right (they
reproduce exactly, section 1 above). The _conclusion_ is not. Upstream did
not omit those components; it reimplemented them, usually in a better form,
as part of the same migrations section 1 of the plan lists.

Of 82 local-only files across `src/openportal` and `src/openportal-remote`
(counting by basename, so upstream's move of e.g. `PullAllocationAction.tsx`
into `actions/` is not miscounted as a gap), **80 are superseded**:

| `details/` in both dirs, `QuotaPie` (+ test + snapshot), `SubmitJobAction`, `SubmitJobDialog`, `AllocationUsersTable`, `provider.ts`, `reports/index.ts`, `RemoteProjectExpandableRow` (~26 files) | Dead code. Nothing outside `src/openportal*` imports them; within it, only each other and their own tests. The one external consumer of the pattern, `src/slurm/`, was deleted upstream entirely, and the fork never modified it.                                     |

Upstream's `src/openportal/routes.ts` is a strict superset of the fork's,
route for route, plus `support.access-for-email`.

**Two files are genuinely new**, both from `72b74c6ca` (2026-08-18):
`ManagedProjectDashboardCards.tsx` and `RemoteProjectDashboardCards.tsx`.

### The tail commits

As on the mastermind side, only the local commits that postdate upstream's
port are real work. Upstream ported OpenPortal in `0b0171df3` (2026-08-06);
exactly **four** local OpenPortal commits are later than that:

| Commit      | Date       | What                                                              |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `9edb6ff5c` | 2026-08-13 | localStorage cache: quota-driven eviction and stale-version purge |
| `a7cf91072` | 2026-08-13 | Bound uncached user-mapping fetches to 100                        |
| `37e0466c6` | 2026-08-17 | Offering filter on the allocation summary                         |
| `72b74c6ca` | 2026-08-18 | Project usage/allocation dashboard cards                          |

Everything earlier was available to upstream's port and is either in
upstream already or superseded per the table above. These four are reshaped
onto upstream's code rather than cherry-picked — `37e0466c6` in particular
is the one that needs the untyped call described in section 3.

## 5. Grace period

Handled per the plan's section 4: rebuilt on `grace_period_days` and
`is_in_grace_period`, after checking what upstream already renders.

## 6. Remaining deltas

Reviewed one at a time against upstream before carrying, per the plan's
section 3.4. Six of the locally modified files no longer exist upstream at
all (`customer/credits/ProjectCreditFormDialog.tsx`,
`customer/details/EditFieldDialog.tsx`, `form/WizardFormContainer.tsx`,
`store/config.ts`, `user/support/UserEditRow.tsx`,
`user/support/UserEditRows.tsx`); the last two are `unix_username` /
`short_name` UI that the plan's section 3.3 deletes anyway.

`unix_username` and `Project.short_name` need no deletion work: the reset
onto upstream removed every file and hunk the plan's section 3.3 lists.
OpenPortal's own `userData.short_name` in `AccessForEmail.tsx` is untouched
and still present, as required.

## 7. Outcome

The fork's delta against upstream at the end of the resync:

|                                              | Files | Insertions | Deletions |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----- | ---------- | --------- |
| Before (fork point `e506ac8e1` -> `e3872e5`) | 325   | 29,488     | 662       |
| After (against `8.1.3-rc.8`)                 | 59    | 2,878      | 177       |

Sixteen of those files are new; the other 43 are edits to upstream files.
Three of the new ones are these notes and a test, so the carried code is
smaller than the line count suggests. The
reduction is almost entirely section 4 — OpenPortal, which the plan expected
to be "the bulk of the job", came down to two new components, four tail
commits and a policy module.

### Verification

Run with Yarn 4 via corepack. `repo.yarnpkg.com` is unreachable through this
environment's proxy, so corepack needs pointing at npm:

```bash
export COREPACK_ENABLE_DOWNLOAD_PROMPT=0
export COREPACK_NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmjs.org
yarn install
```

| Check             | Result                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `yarn tsgo -b`    | clean                                                |
| `yarn lint:check` | 0 errors, 419 warnings — exactly upstream's baseline |
| `yarn test --run` | 3,529 pass, 6 skipped, 0 fail                        |
| `yarn build`      | succeeds                                             |

The 419 lint warnings are upstream's own and were measured on the untouched
tree before any local work; nothing here adds to them.

`yarn i18n:validate` warns about 13,273 potential missing translations. That
is also upstream's baseline, measured the same way — `locales/en.json` holds
a handful of overrides rather than a full catalogue.

### Not carried, but worth knowing

Three things the fork did in code are better done in mastermind settings now:

- **Hiding the marketplace.** Set `WALDUR_CORE.SERVICE_ACCESS_MODE` to
  `'calls'`. Upstream's sidebar reads it, along with
  `hide_marketplace_from_end_users`. The fork's two hardcoded booleans are
  gone.
- **`show_slug_as_id` and `make_slugs_immutable`** still work as before, but
  the `unix_username` precondition the fork put in front of the first is gone
  with the field itself.
- **`application_portal_only`** is now unread by the frontend. Both its uses
  were in code deleted here.

Three call sites cast their query object because the published
`waldur-js-client` lagged the resynced mastermind branch. All three carried a
comment pointing here, and all three are now resolved against an SDK generated
locally from mastermind at `7ecfbd17`:

| Call site                                          | Was missing from the client                                    | Resolution                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `openportal/reports/OrganisationAllocationTab.tsx` | `include_offering_names`, and `offering_names` on the response | cast dropped; uses `ProjectAccountingSummary` directly              |
| `project/ProjectProfile.tsx`                       | `project_uuid` on the proposals list                           | proposals section removed — see below                               |
| `customer/team/CustomerUsersList.tsx`              | `slug` in `CustomerUserFieldEnum`                              | cast dropped; `'slug'` moved into the typed `mandatoryFields` array |

The second of these was a correction to the plan's section 6, which concluded
that every field dropped with the local proposal work sat inside
`src/proposals`. `ProjectProfile` is outside it and depended on the proposals
list's `project_uuid` filter.

That dependency turned out to be unsatisfiable rather than merely lagging.
`ProposalFilter.project_uuid` was added by mastermind's `d882786c` and removed
again by `66bc113c` ("Reset residual local changes in the proposal app to
upstream"), so the regenerated schema offers no route at all from a project to
its proposals. Without the filter the query reads as unfiltered and the card
listed every proposal in the deployment — a data leak, not a cosmetic bug.
Restoring it would mean putting that one line back into the proposal app and
giving up the "proposal app stays pure upstream" decision.

**Decision: the proposals section is removed from `ProjectProfile`.** This
deployment does not surface proposals, so there is nothing to show and no
reason to carry a fork delta in the proposal app for it. `ProjectProfile.test.ts`
went with it. Should a later deployment need the card back, the change is the
single filter field in mastermind plus a revert of `35d8d25ed4` here.

One upstream bug found and fixed here, worth offering back: upstream's
`src/echarts/index.ts` does not register the `dataZoom` component or the
`treemap` chart, both of which its own ported OpenPortal report charts use.

## Moving to 8.1.3-rc.15

The merge from `8.1.3-rc.8` to `8.1.3-rc.15` (326 commits, 1,416 files) is
committed and green: `yarn tsgo -b` clean, lint clean, 4,381 tests passing.

### The SDK was the whole of the blocker

On the merge commit itself the tree had **194 type errors, none of them in this
fork's code**. Every one was a symbol the rc.15 frontend expects from a newer
mastermind schema than the fork's `waldur-js-client` had been generated from —
`rolesHygieneReportRetrieve`, `RoleHygieneFinding`, `Rule.user_identity_sources`,
`RmqQueueStats.queue_kind`, `EventConsumer.user_username`, and so on across the
administration, marketplace and openstack areas. All were present in the client
upstream itself pinned, so nothing was missing upstream; the fork's client was
simply older.

Shimming or casting around them was rejected. The strict typing is precisely
what shows when the schema has moved, and hiding that would have hidden a real
signal. The branch was left red instead until `chryswoods/js-client` was
regenerated and tagged `8.1.3-rc.15-openportal.1`. Bumping to that tag took the
194 errors to zero, which is the confirmation that the diagnosis was right and
that nothing in this fork's code needed changing for rc.15.

Two errors did surface that were genuinely ours, both slips in the same
conflict resolution: unioning two import blocks dropped `PlusCircleIcon` in
`TeamDropdownActions.tsx`, and kept a now-dead `ThemeSwitcherButton` import in
`LoginColumn.tsx` (upstream moved the switcher inside `AuthHeaderControls`).
The lesson for the next resync: a union of import blocks is not automatically
safe — the body may have moved out from under it either way.

### The eleven conflicts and how they were resolved

| File                                                 | Resolution                                                                                                                                                            |

| `src/project/team/ProjectUsersList.tsx`              | union: keep `user_slug`, add upstream's `source`                                                                                                                      |

| `src/project/ProjectProfile.tsx`                     | upstream's `waldur-ui` Badge import; keep our `daysUntilAccessEnds` and `CopyToClipboardButton`                                                                       |
| `src/project/ProjectLifecycleBadge.tsx`              | upstream's Badge API (`shape`/`tone`); keep our exclusive-end-date logic and the "last day" wording                                                                   |
| `src/marketplace/resources/details/EndDateField.tsx` | upstream's `Tooltip`; keep our `formatRelativeEndDate` and `lastAccessDate`                                                                                           |
| `src/navigation/sidebar/CallPublicMenu.tsx`          | keep our `return null` (finding 9); upstream only restyled the menu it replaced                                                                                       |
| `src/project/ProjectDashboard.tsx`                   | drop upstream's duplicated widget Row — moving the description block down made git append it — and hand-port its one real change, `canViewTeam()`, onto our team gate |

`src/openportal/award-pace/AwardPaceCard.tsx` also needed converting to the
`waldur-ui` Badge and Tooltip API (`Variant` -> `BadgeVariant`, `pill outline`
-> `shape="pill" tone="outline"`, `Tip` -> `Tooltip`, which drops the `id`
prop). It is the only file of ours that the design-system migration touches.

### Upstream has fixed finding 2

`hasPermission` now iterates every matching role with `.some()` rather than
taking the first, which is what this fork's fix did, and adds service-provider
scope handling on top. Take upstream's version; ours is superseded. Finding 2
can be struck from `upstream-bug-reports.md` now that this merge has landed.

Findings 1, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are untouched at rc.15 — `src/echarts/index.ts`,
`GracePeriodWarningBar.tsx` and `UserImpersonateButton.tsx` are byte-identical
to rc.8, and `Table.tsx` changed only to move the filter header, not the
initialisation effect.

### The size of the rest

`waldur-ui` becomes the design system between rc.8 and rc.15: imports of it go
from 4 files to 484, and `src/core/Badge.tsx` is deleted. The prop API changes
(`pill` → `shape="pill"`, `light`/`outline` → `tone=`, `Variant` →
`BadgeVariant`). That conversion is mechanical and `tsgo` finds all of it, but
it is the bulk of the work, and it lands on the policy-watch and award cards
this fork has been building.
