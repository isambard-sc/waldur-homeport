 * drawn down by. Under award accounting the two are not the same: OpenPortal
 * sets the credit balance directly and writes no compensation items, so a chart
 * keyed on compensation is flat zero for every month while the project is
 * plainly consuming.
 *
 * The axis spans the given window rather than the months that happen to have
 * invoices, so the bars march across a fixed frame as the window runs and an
 * empty month reads as an empty month rather than being absent.
